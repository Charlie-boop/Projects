The Forage - Commonwealth Bank Intro to Data Science

It is a self-driven, guided exercise to simulate the work I would be doing for the Commonwealth Bank.

This folder contains all the files I worked on during the exercises, as a form of proof for all my work there.

For this project I used Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Access, Python "Faker" library and X's (formerly Twitter) API.

The process involved four different phases:
1) Data Analysis on a provided Spreadsheet, using tools within Microsoft Excel.
2) Data Anonymization techniques on the provided Spreadsheet, again using tools within Microsoft Excel.
3) Use X's API to track the last few tweets from Commonwealth Bank's own account using Python Scripts and propose on how the gathered insight may be used for the benefit of the business.
4) Draft a database structure that will help store the tweets gathered from the Commonwealth Bank's X Account

The greatest insights I took from this project would on how to use the X API and the Python "Faker" library, as those were tools I had never used before this point.
I also got to reinforce some previously learned skills from the Microsoft Office suite.
