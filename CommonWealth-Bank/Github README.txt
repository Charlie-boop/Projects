The Forage - Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights by the Tata Group

It is a self-driven, guided exercise to simulate the work I would be doing for the Tata Group.

This folder contains all the files I worked on and studied from during the exercises, as proof of my work there.

For this project I used Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerBI and OBS Studio (to record audio).

The process involved four different phases:
1) Framing the Business Scenario, making use of my critical thinking skills and Microsoft Word.
2) A simple quiz evaluating my understanding of the topics provided. I cannot provide the quiz, so instead I will provide the lecture material shared with me.
3) Create visuals centered around four questions, using PowerBI. 
4) Develop a script and record a video presenting the findings based on the previous exercise. For my privacy's sake I will not offer the video- just the script.

The greatest insight I took from this project was on communicating insights and expressing them through Microsoft's PowerBI.
I also got to reinforce some previously learned skills from the Microsoft Office suite.
