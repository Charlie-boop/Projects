The database structure I propose is as follows:

Tables:

Table - Users
FieldName: userID  Type: Integer (Primary Key)  Description: Unique user ID

FieldName: userName  Type: Varchar  Description: Unique user handle

FieldName: displayName  Type: Varchar  Description: Displayed user name


Table- Tweets
FieldName: tweetID  Type: Integer (Primary Key)  Description: Unique tweet ID

FieldName: userID  Type: Integer (Foreign Key)  Description: user ID, referencing the author

FieldName: tweetContent  Type: Text   Description: Tweet's content (nullable for retweets with no comment)

FieldName: createdAt  Type: Date  Description: Time Stamp

FieldName: parentID  Type: Integer (Foreign Key)  Description: Points to original tweet if reply/retweet

FieldName: tweetType  Type: Enumerated  Description: Has "tweet", "reply", "retweet", and "quote" as possible values

FieldName: favorites  Type: Integer  Description: Number of Likes

FieldName: retweets  Type: Integer  Description: Number of Retweets

FieldName: views  Type: Integer  Description: Number of Views


Table- Mentions
FieldName: userID  Type: Integer (Foreign Key)  Description: The mentioned user

FieldName: tweetID  Type: Integer (Foreign Key)  Description: The tweet where the mention appears


Relationships:

User and Tweets - One To Many, with Tweets userID as the Foreign key. Reasoning: A user can author many tweets

Tweets with itself - One To Many, with Tweets parentID as the Foreign key. Reasoning: Replies, retweets and quotes can all reference a tweet

Tweets and Mentions - One To Many, with Mentions tweetID as the Foreign key. Reasoning: A tweet can mention many users

Users and Mentions - One To Many, with Mentions userID as the Foreign key. Reasoning: A user can be mentioned in many tweets
