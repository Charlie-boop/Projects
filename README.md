Houston Community College - Sudoku Game 

It is a self-driven, guided exercise done in Java as part of my final project assignment in Houston Community College.

This folder contains all the files used in and created during the project, as proof of my work there.

For this project I principally the Java IntelliJ IDEA environment to write the code in.

The process involved four different phases:
1) Drafting out visual concepts for the project.
2) Write out the project code.
3) Create an executable to demonstrate functionality. 
4) Sharing the files as a ZIP attachment to my professor.

The greatest insight I took from this project was learning to apply programming concepts in a functional manner.
I also got to reinforce some previously learned skills from my programming classes taken throughout my degree.
