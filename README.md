GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation from Tata Group

It is a self-driven, guided exercise to simulate the work I would be doing for the Tata Group, powered by Generative AI.

For this project I used the DeepSeek Generative AI chatbot, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Powerpoint.

The Process involved four different phases:
1) Conduct an AI-assisted EDA on the provided Dataset, finding flaws in the data such as: gaps, quality issues, missing data, patterns and risk factors. Create a report with the findings at the end.
2) Generating model logic also using GenAI, justifying my choice of model, explain how model performance will be evaluated and submitting a plan as a document.
3) Use the previously gathered insights to explain customer trends, pick an insight and create a SMART business recommendation, outline ethical considerations and have it all done in a report.
4) Create a Powerpoint Presentation explaining the model, using the general structure of my previous EDA report, tailored for an executive meeting setting.

In addition, I was to be quizzed on lecture material provided throughout each step.

The greatest insights I discovered during this exercise was using Generative AI to create mathematical models through increasingly specific prompts.
