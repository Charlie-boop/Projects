The Forage- Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

It is a self-driven, guided exercise to simulate the Data Analysis work I would be doing for the Tata Group.

The folders contain all the files used and studied from, as proof of my work there.

For this project I used Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerBI and  OBS Studio

The process involved four different phases:
1) Thinking critically to generate both quantitative and qualitative questions in preparation for an executive meeting.
2) Studying from the provided lecture material and then answering a multiple-choice quiz on the subject.
3) Using a provided dataset, generate visual material geared to answer a series of questions about the dataset.
4) Develop a script and record a video presenting my findings to the executives.

The greatest insights taken from this exercise was the experience in working with Microsoft PowerBI, reinforcing my knowledge of microsoft's tools.
