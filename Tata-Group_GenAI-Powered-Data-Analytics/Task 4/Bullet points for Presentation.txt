How the System Works (Slide 2):

Customer Data Collected:
ID Number, Age, Income, Credit Score, Credit Utilization, Missed Payments, Delinquency Status, Loan Balance, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Employment Status, Account Tenure, Credit Card Type, Location and Payment History

Decision Logic:
The decision-making is guided by model predictions, in that it will do most of the math and pattern examination, but final decisions will be made by humans, obeying business logic.

Actions:
By missing 3 months, customers are targeted with a messaging campaign to encourage debt restructuring.
Alerting the customer of their credit usage four times, upon reaching the 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% usage thresholds.
Financial advising will be offered to customers earning less than $50,000 a year while also offering the opportunity for payment plans.

Learning:
The model will observe changes in Payment behavior and Credit Utilization to assess progress. The Agent then should adapt its response accordingly, with no intervention.

Role of Agentic AI (Slide 3):

Fully Automated Decisions Include:
Sending Emails, Detecting unusual customer behavior, Making predictions regarding customer risk

Human Decisions Include:
Manual review of flagged customers, Assess model accuracy through SHAP values, Offering hardship plans

Responsible AI Guardrails (Slide 4):

The System will endure fairness through:
Metrics like Equal Opportunity, Disparate Impact Ratios, Calibration within Groups and Feature Importance Auditing.
The model will be monitored for any drift and trained on new data quarterly.
Regulatory Compliance with local laws, GDPR and ECOA
Outliers will be reviewed manually, Hardship Payments will be handled manually, Human Decisions use additional alternative data sources outside of the model.

Expected Business Impact (Slide 5):

The system should benefit Geldium's business objectives by producing two kinds of outcomes:
Quantitative: Delinquencies should be reduced, Payment behaviors should shift more towards more repayments, Reduced labor costs, Overall risk reduction

Qualitative: Improved customer satisfaction, Increased scalability, Improved fairness towards stakeholders, Data Interpretability should improve
