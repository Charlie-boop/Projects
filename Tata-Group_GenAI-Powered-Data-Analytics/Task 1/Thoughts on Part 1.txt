Thoughts on Part 1

I am required to think on questions about the dataset:
What are the Key Variables?
What categorical or numerical data points are there?
Are there missing or inconsistent values?

Ask the AI to like
Analyze trends and correlations between columns in that dataset
What key patterns are in the dataset and identify anomalies
Suggest an imputation strategy for missing income values, loan balance values
What indicators of delinquency risk are there?
